# The Last Star

Captain Elena Rodriguez floated in the observation deck of the *Voyager's Promise*, watching the last star in the visible universe slowly dim. After millennia of expansion, the universe had grown so vast that galaxies had drifted beyond the cosmic horizon, their light no longer able to reach across the ever-expanding void.

"How much longer?" she whispered into the darkness.

"Approximately 47 hours," the ship's AI responded, its voice gentle despite the apocalyptic math.

Elena had volunteered for this mission—to witness the end, to record humanity's final observations of the cosmos. Her crew of twelve floated in cryosleep behind her, their dreams filled with memories of Earth, a planet that had ceased to exist trillions of years ago.

The star pulsed weakly, a red dwarf gasping its last breaths of fusion. When it finally winked out, there would be nothing left but the cosmic microwave background radiation, growing colder and more diffuse with each passing eon.

But Elena smiled. In her pocket, she carried a small vial—seeds from the last garden ship, DNA samples, frozen embryos. The universe might be dying, but life was stubborn. The *Voyager's Promise* had one more jump left in its ancient drives, one more leap into the unknown darkness.

As the star dimmed to nearly nothing, Elena made her choice. She programmed the coordinates—not based on logic or probability, but on hope. The ship shuddered, reality bent, and they vanished into the void.

Where they emerged, no one could say. But in the infinite possibilities of existence, perhaps there was still light to be found, and a new story waiting to begin.

*The End*
